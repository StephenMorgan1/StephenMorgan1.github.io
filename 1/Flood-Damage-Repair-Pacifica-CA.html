<p>Assessment reports and lawsuits by seven next-door neighbors on the block now declare that construction problems permitted water to gush into her walls. In the Shorts' home, a moisture-inspection test revealed that some parts of their wall had likely disintegrated and developed mold. Paper implied to line the roof, rather than the kind required by the building code, was utilized on the walls.
