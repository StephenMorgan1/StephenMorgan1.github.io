The dew point is the temperature the air requires to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to attain an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas type. If the air were to be cooled much more, water vapor would need to come out of the environment in a liquid form. The higher the dew point increases, the higher the amount of moisture in the air.</p>
