<p>There are two methods which water goes into a building as a result of windstorm damage. The very first includes falling or windblown rainwater that goes into since of damage to roofing components or wall assemblies. The second involves horizontally taking a trip ground-surface water (Category 3) including silt and soil impurities that infiltrates into structures, normally through doors or around structure walls. This ground-surface water (storm rise) may collect to a depth of numerous feet or numerous inches.

<p>Mold needs nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperature levels to grow. Nutrients for mold exist in dead natural material such as wood, paper or fabrics; mold can also derive nutrients from some synthetic products such as paints and adhesives. Mold needs wetness, although some mold species can obtain that moisture from damp air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent.

The permeable material can quickly absorb flood water, and you need to know the extent of prospective damage.<p>
