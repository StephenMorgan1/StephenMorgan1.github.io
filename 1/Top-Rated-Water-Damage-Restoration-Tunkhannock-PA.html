<p>Recent Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to do the job properly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>An option of cleaning agent and warm water can be used to scrub surface mold off non-porous surfaces. Although cleaning agent itself does not kill mold, if the mold is on non-porous products then the option does not need to eliminate it as long as you totally clean away all the mold on the surface. Using a pump sprayer, mist the surface areas with water to manage the spread of spores, and roll up the sections. Double-wrap them in. 6-mm plastic and tape them with duct tape for disposal.<p>
