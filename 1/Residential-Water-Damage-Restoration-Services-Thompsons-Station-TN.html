<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Amongst the products we use to deal with mold problems is the resurfacing agent Microorganism Guard, which creates a new, permanent layer over a surface area.

A foundation of our technique to mold remediation is comprehensive avoidance that blocks the regrowth of damaging mold. People constructing a new home or structure will discover our avoidance techniques particularly essential.</p>
