<p>Flooding of a private sewer system can be a dangerous situation for homeowners, according to Plumbing 2.0's seasoned plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It might cause a back-up of sewage in the home, infected drinking water and lack of sanitation till the system is repaired. When flooding or saturated soil conditions continue, a personal sewer system can not operate appropriately (typical pipes problems in old homes ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater depend on aerobic (with oxygen) regions to reduce the quantities of chemicals and living organisms (infections, germs and protozoa). When the soil is filled or flooded, those harmful materials can go into the groundwater and your drinking supply of water.</p>
