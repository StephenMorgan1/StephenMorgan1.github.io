<h3>Emergency Fire and Smoke Damage Cleanup in Copiague</h3>
<p>Remove paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. It can be an irreversible health risk and need to be removed if soaked by polluted floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the idea of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
