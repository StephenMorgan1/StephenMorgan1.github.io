<h3>House Water Damage in Riverside Connecticut</h2>
<p>Sadly, however, using bleach is only efficient if the mold is growing on non-porous materials such as tiles, tubs, glass and counter tops. Bleach can not penetrate into porous products and so it does not enter contact with mold growing beneath the surface of materials such as wood and drywall. Using bleach on these products will kill the mold above the surface area but the roots within the material will stay and the mold will soon return.</p>
<p>The most reliable way to avoid mold growth on water damage is to begin the drying process quickly. Restoration companies that know possible mold growth problems generally understand how to dry structural materials by lowering the indoor humidity, sensibly move air and in many cases heat the afflicted area.
