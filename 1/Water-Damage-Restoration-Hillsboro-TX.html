<h3>Importance of Hiring Fire Damage Cleanup Specialist in Hillsboro</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be a permanent health danger and ought to be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the idea of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
