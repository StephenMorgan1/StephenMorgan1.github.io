<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Look for noticeable mold growth (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or leatherlike and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or building products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper).

<p>Indoor mold growth can typically be seen or smelled. Most of the times, if visible mold development exists, tasting is not required. There are no health or exposure-based standards that you can use to examine a mold tasting outcome. The Florida Department of Health does not advise mold screening or sampling to see if you have a mold issue, or to see what type of mold may be growing. Sampling for mold in the air can be costly and, if done, need to just be done by experienced experts. Examine a mold issue; do not test</p>
<p>My store leaks and my brothers cars and truck was parked while we replaced the engine during the hot and damp summertime. Mold was all over the vehicle's interior.

<p>Building products such as sheetrock and wood are prime sources of food for mold. Likewise, interior surfaces such as carpet, wallpaper, and other textiles are ideal for mold colonization and growth. Mold thrives on organic products.
