<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for each two to three spaces, depending upon the size of the room. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it goes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the odor got rid of. This procedure goes on for days. As you can think of, over the course of numerous days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
