<p>If smoke and fire damage has actually affected your personal belongings, we will work with you and your insurance provider to identify what can be brought back, and what will be an insurance coverage replacement claim. For products that can be restored, we utilize ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged valuables. For this, we used Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is act like a glue which permeates into permeable surface area, preventing water from leaking back through. Essentially, it makes the area solid again and protects the surface area from future water damage. After you have used the Peel-Stop, enable an hour of drying time.<p>
<p>Our experts constantly examine the area initially. After the evaluation, they get rid of and replace the required pieces only.
