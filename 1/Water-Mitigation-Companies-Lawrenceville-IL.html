<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Amongst the products we use to attend to mold problems is the resurfacing agent Microbe Guard, which develops a new, irreversible layer over a surface. By resisting microbial assaults, the brand-new surface can seal out mold, giving it no possibility to grow. But Microbe Guard is simply one aspect of our well-rounded services. A foundation of our technique to mold remediation is thorough prevention that obstructs the regrowth of damaging mold. People constructing a new home or structure will find our avoidance strategies specifically crucial.</p>
