<p>Due to the fact that typical structure materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually related to water or wetness exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
