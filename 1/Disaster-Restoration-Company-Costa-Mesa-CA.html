<p>Deterioration is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the slow and progressive degeneration of materials (normally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration takes place when you combine electrical power, metal, water and oxygen, developing iron oxide (or what is more commonly called rust). There is no trustworthy schedule for this procedure to take place; a MacBook's internal components generally begin rusting right away after the spill, but in some cases your Mac can function normally for days or weeks without showing any obvious sign of an issue. How fast the corrosion procedure takes depends on a lots of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and for how long the device remained in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all up until you can attend to the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust caused by a water spill.</p>
