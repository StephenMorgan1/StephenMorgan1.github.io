<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he discovered how much water expense I was paying given that the leakage began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & discovered of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Really polite and easy-going individual.</p>
