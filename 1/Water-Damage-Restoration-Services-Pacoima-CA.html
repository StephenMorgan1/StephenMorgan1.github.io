<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>The most effective water damage restoration tasks begin with a thorough extraction; our proprietary extraction equipment will begin things off on the ideal foot. We will then supply you with a drying plan and the appropriate equipment to complete the procedure. We invest greatly in the most updated drying devices to control the drying procedure.

<p>Recent Evaluation: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and carried away whatever else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to do the job appropriately.
