<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens. An automated shut-off valve is excellent insurance coverage to have in any situation, especially when the hot water heater unit is located inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your hot water heater is imminent unless fixed quickly, and the costs go up the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The culprit may have been something as easy as a pressure relief valve requiring changing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>
<p>Because typical structure products can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
