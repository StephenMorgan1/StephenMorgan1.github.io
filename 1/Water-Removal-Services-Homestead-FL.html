<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of property damage that a family or organisation can experience. When MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other parts.

This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight if this rust process is not stopped.</p>
