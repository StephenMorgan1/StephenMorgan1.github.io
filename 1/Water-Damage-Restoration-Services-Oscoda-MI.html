<h2>What To Do & What Not To Do After Flood Damage in Oscoda</h2>

<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally destructive. Jake and his guys were incredible in assisting us survive flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to the house and started drying out our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (frequently twice a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained everything they were doing along the way and also were very valuable in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
<p>Constantly gotten ready for a difficulty, Bales put together a drying plan that completely dried whatever in 7 days with minimal trouble to the personnel and kids. Using state-of-the-art equipment, Bales technicians put little holes into the cabinets and walls on both sides, then required air into and out of the trapped spaces. We dried the carpet and pad in place and used HEPA air scrubbers to keep the air clean throughout the procedure. Restoration was unnecessary due to the fact that of our drying techniques and devices.</p>

<p>Once standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually soaked up (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily depending on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any modifications.</p>
