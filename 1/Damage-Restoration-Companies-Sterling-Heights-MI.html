<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one air stream. The rotor brings the moist desiccant to the reactivation jet stream to heat it up.

This process absorbs moisture without ice accumulation and is not limited by low temperature levels. Desiccants can quickly run below freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>Ice dams and other roof issues can also cause water damage to siding materials as well.
