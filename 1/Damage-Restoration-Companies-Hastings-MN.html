<p>Find out how to eliminate black mold safely and successfully. Burst or damaged pipes can be a major headache when you have water damage and aren't sure immediately from where the source of damage is originating from. Sprinkler line pipeline burst often goes undetected until the water comes rushing through basement window wells and walls causing substantial basement water damage. A pipeline burst in the attic can lead to gallons of water raining down on the spaces inside your home.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
