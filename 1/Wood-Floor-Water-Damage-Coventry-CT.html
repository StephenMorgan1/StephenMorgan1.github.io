<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>

<p>When standing water is removed, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has absorbed (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process includes examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature level also, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any adjustments if you have questions on this.</p>
