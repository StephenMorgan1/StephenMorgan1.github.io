<p>It's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove up to 18 inches of drywall because mold and mildew can be a serious health risk. However, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product should be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with full sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>After you find out how to get rid of mold, concentrate on avoiding it in the future. Controlling dampness is the key to stopping most mold. The worst problems usually occur in damp crawl spaces, attics, walls where water leaked in from the outdoors, and in basements with poor foundation drainage. Stopping leakages, ensuring excellent ventilation in attics, keeping crawl areas dry and routing water away from the foundation are the best defenses versus mold.</p>
