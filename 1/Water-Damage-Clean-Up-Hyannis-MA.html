<p>Corrosion is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the steady and sluggish wear and tear of products (typically metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion occurs when you integrate electrical power, metal, water and oxygen, creating iron oxide (or what is more commonly called rust). There is no reliable schedule for this process to occur; a MacBook's internal elements generally start corroding right away after the spill, but in many cases your Mac can function usually for days or weeks without showing any obvious sign of an issue. How quick the rust procedure takes depends upon a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and for how long the gadget remained in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all until you can address the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust triggered by a water spill.</p>
