<p>Any structure that has actually suffered from water damage or issues with excess wetness is at danger of mold development. Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water direct exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Long-term staining on walls and floorings is another potential impact of water damage. Walls and flooring may need replacement or refinishing depending on the extent of damage. Moldy odors can remain in a home where leaks or flooding have occurred and this could be indicative of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
