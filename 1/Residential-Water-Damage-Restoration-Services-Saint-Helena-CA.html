<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, many expert drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't constantly practical. Using paper tape needs some practice and little skill, but it's well worth learning. When the meters read wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the service technician will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this point, the water remediation procedure is considered to complete.<p>
