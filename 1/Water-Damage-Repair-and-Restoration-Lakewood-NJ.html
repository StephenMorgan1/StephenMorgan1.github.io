<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

<p>Specific sections of your home such as crawl basements, attics and spaces are a lot more susceptible to water damage. Dark, moist crawl spaces can be a sanctuary for mold and mildew, which is turn can then trigger structural damage as they flourish.

While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can trigger enduring damage and needs to be handled by knowledgeable professionals, heat is the most obvious, and damaging, item of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - meaning that as a fire comes into contact with additional fuel, the response continues and the fire spreads.</p>

Some products will handle more water than others, and some materials can be more challenging to dry.
