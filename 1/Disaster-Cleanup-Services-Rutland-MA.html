For this, we utilized Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is imitate a glue which permeates into porous surface area, avoiding water from permeating back through. Basically, it makes the area solid once again and protects the surface area from future water damage. After you have used the Peel-Stop, allow for an hour of drying time.<p>
<p>The time it considers the mold removal procedure depends on many factors such as how much mold is present, where the mold is growing (behind walls, and so on), and the products it grows on. A lot of mold removal (remediation) takes anywhere from 1 day to 5 days. Water damaged carpeting and drywall will naturally dry.
