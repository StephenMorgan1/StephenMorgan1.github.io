For this, we utilized Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is imitate a glue which permeates into porous surface area, avoiding water from permeating back through. Basically, it makes the area solid once again and protects the surface area from future water damage. After you have used the Peel-Stop, allow for an hour of drying time.<p>
