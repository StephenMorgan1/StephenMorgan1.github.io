<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air up until they land someplace. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the very same way, so if the location the spores land is damp and great, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Since tiny mold spores exist naturally practically all over, inside your home and outdoors, eliminating all mold from a home or organisation is difficult. Many restoration companies promote mold removal" and even guarantee to get rid of all mold. This is a fallacy. We understand mold and mold development.
