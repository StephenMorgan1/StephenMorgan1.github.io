<p>Any building that has experienced water damage or problems with excess wetness is at danger of mold growth. Use a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore defense, and cover hands, legs and arms to avoid contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to eliminate noticeable mold. If the musty area is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will reduce the incidence of air-borne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, utilize commercial black mold removal items, which can be found in most hardware or home repair stores, to decontaminate the moldy areas, in addition to any adjacent areas. Make sure it will not discolor the product or surface if you use bleach. Place all sponges, devices and other materials used in cleaning in a heavy duty garbage bag, and if possible, remove the bag through a close-by exit as opposed to the primary home, to avoid distributing mold spores.</p>
<p>Getting it wet can turn into a major headache because the plaster drywall is permeable and soluble in water. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get damp and just starts to droop before drying, repairing it may just need pressing it back into location, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
