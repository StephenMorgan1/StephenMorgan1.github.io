<p>Because common building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or moisture exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
