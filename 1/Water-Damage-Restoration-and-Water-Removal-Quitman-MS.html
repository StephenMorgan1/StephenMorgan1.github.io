<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Try to find noticeable mold growth (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or leathery and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently appears as a staining or fuzzy development on furnishings or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Look for signs of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water spots, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>Our group will come out to your property to assess the fire and examine and smoke damage that has happened. Once dry-out is complete, our approach to fire damage cleanup and smoke damage removal starts with state of the art ventilation technology to clean out your home and eliminate particles drifting in the air. We then begin the process of cleaning walls, floorings, ceilings, carpet, and upholstery that isn't beyond being restored.
