<p>As wetness is released in the air, nature always tries to reach balance. Determining the humidity is important in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The humidity constantly occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature the air needs to be cooled to, at constant pressure, in order to achieve an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas form. If the air were to be cooled much more, water vapor would need to come out of the environment in a liquid type. The higher the humidity rises, the greater the quantity of moisture in the air.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for every single 2 to 3 rooms, depending on the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it goes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and accredited to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which means that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of several days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
