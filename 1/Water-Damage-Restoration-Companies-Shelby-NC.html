<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's going at the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he found out how much water expense I was paying given that the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & found of the leakage for me and then even assisted me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely respectful individual.</p>
