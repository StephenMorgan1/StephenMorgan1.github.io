<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of property damage that a family or service can experience. As soon as MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Typically, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with a very costly paperweight if this rust process is not stopped.</p>
