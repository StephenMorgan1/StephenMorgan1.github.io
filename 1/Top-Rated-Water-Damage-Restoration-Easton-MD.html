<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be extremely devastating. Jake and his people were remarkable in assisting us survive flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to your house and began drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (frequently two times a day) to keep track of and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the way and also were really useful in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
