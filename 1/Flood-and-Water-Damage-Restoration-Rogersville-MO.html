<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many people think that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread, harming a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a large location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
