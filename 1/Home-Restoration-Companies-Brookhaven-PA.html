<p>We will do our best to restore your contents to a pre-loss condition. Some products, when exposed to water for a time period, become permanently damaged (i.e. they will never be the same). Other items may merely need to be sanitized and transferred to high ground. Soft products like clothing, bedspreads, drapes can be sent to a laundry service that we can arrange for you. Another point is, there are various levels of contamination with water (see Categories of Water), and that will factor into the equation of what can be conserved and what should be replaced. We will deal with you throughout the loss, reserving items that we feel can not be efficiently restored so you can make a list to become your insurance adjuster. Your Adjuster will then figure out a compensation for your items according to the terms of your policy.</p>
