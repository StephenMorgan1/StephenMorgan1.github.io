<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Water damage, water invasion, constructing envelope issues, and construction problems are a very severe matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding areas are experiencing many issues due to leaking doors and windows, water and wind driven rain damage.

Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
