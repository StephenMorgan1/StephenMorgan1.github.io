Mold on the exterior of the house isn't just unattractive - it can also eventually migrate to the interior and trigger further damage. A typical location where mold might appear on the outside of a home includes the decks, which can be cleaned up with detergent or other light cleaning solution and a power washer.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or damp.

Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have actually become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
