<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and carried away everything else.  We were very pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to get the job done effectively.
