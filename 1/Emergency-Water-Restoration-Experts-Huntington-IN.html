<p>Any building that has actually experienced water damage or problems with excess moisture is at risk of mold development. Wear a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore protection, and cover arms, hands and legs to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to eliminate noticeable mold. If the moldy area is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will minimize the occurrence of airborne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, use business black mold removal products, which can be discovered in most hardware or home repair shops, to sanitize the musty locations, in addition to any nearby locations. Make sure it won't blemish the product or surface area if you utilize bleach.
