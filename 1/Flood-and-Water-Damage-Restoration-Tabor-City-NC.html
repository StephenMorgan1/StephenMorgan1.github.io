<p>The initial step to fixing water damage in your house is to determine the source of the water. In some cases, like damaged pipes or natural disaster, the source will be quickly recognizable. However, in other cases the cause might be difficult to recognize if it lags a wall or ceiling. When the source of water is recognized you will need to take actions to remedy the problem and seal the leakage. When we got the emergency water-damage call for this flooded office building, bales Restoration was prepared. One of the flexible lines from the HEATING AND COOLING system on the 4th floor failed and drained the system.<p>
<p>Mold Inspection Sciences of Seattle specializes in mold assessment, mold detection, and mold testing We do not carry out mold remediation, thus there are no conflicts of interest. When vacuuming and utilizing air scrubbers for mold remediation, the filters used need to be HEPA (High Effectiveness Particulate Air). Just HEPA filters are designed to catch particles as small as mold spores. Routine filters will not work, and could make the issue even worse.<p>
