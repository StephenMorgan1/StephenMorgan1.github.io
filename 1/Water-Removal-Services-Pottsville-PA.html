<p>The expense of electrical use for our equipment is generally less than people think. Simply the very same, it is typically an expense that is gotten by your insurance carrier, if your policy permits it. We have a calculator that calculates the extra electrical expense from our equipment, based upon the optimum amp draw of each piece of equipment multiplied by the number of days we had it running.

However contrary to the popular view, it isn't. Bleach is a strong chemical which can damage your health. Likewise, it does not get rid of the mold. It just alters its color from black to white or grey. After a couple of weeks of bleaching, there is still a big possibility that the mold will return.</p>
