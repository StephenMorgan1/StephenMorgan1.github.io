<p>Any building that has actually suffered from water damage or problems with excess moisture is at risk of mold development. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Permanent staining on walls and floorings is another prospective effect of water damage. Walls and flooring may require replacement or refinishing depending on the extent of damage. Moldy odors can linger in a home where leakages or flooding have taken place and this might be indicative of excess mold and mildew development.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
