<p>Water invasion into buildings can be incredibly harmful. When InstaScope was produced, we engaged a team of scientists at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a worldwide acknowledged professional on the biological aspects of air contamination, this group was appointed to confirm and check the brand-new technology. Needless to state, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to create a brand-new mold-assessment system for business consumers that, unlike any other technique or gadget, can provide scientifically accurate, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so quickly. So when you consider all the dangers of mold, InstaScope is an essential tool to help make sure the health of your home and the health of your family.</p>
