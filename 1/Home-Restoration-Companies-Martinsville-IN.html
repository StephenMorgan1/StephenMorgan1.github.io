Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season.

<p>As wetness is launched in the air, nature always attempts to reach equilibrium. Computing the dew point is necessary in drying since when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The humidity always takes place at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature the air requires to be cooled to, at consistent pressure, in order to accomplish an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas type.
