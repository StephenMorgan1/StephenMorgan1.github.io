<p>Since common building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is generally related to water or wetness exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
