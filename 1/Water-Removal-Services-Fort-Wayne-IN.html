<p>Normally, indoor air levels of Stachybotrys are low. As with other kinds of mold, at greater levels negative health results may occur. These include cold-like signs, rashes, sinus inflammation, eye inflammation and irritation of asthma. Some signs are more basic - such as failure to concentrate or tiredness. Normally, signs vanish after the mold is gotten rid of. Mitigation is considered an emergency service. Water has the damaging tendency to cause pervasive damage to products that absorb it.
