<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the water company told me if it's going at the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt how much water expense I was paying given that the leak began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & found of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me closed down my main water valve. Easy-going and really polite person.</p>
