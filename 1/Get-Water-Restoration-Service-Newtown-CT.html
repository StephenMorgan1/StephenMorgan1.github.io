Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
