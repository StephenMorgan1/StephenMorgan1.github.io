<p>While the iPhone 7 and later are water-resistant, it does not stop water from getting into the speaker grille. The Apple Watch Series 2 and later have a comparable concern, although they include an integrated function that can be toggled to 'eject' the water by playing a particular frequency. The worst problem with mold is that it has the potential to cause health impacts. Mold can trigger allergic reactions and even asthma attacks, as some people dislike mold. As mold needs water to grow it is very important to prevent wetness and humidity problems in structures, particularly ones impacted by water.<p>
