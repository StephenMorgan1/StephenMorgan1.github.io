The CDC recommends that you wear long pants and a long-sleeve shirt, protective gloves and eyewear, water resistant boots, and a mask rated at least N-95 or more to safeguard your nose and mouth.

<p>Because common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is usually associated with water or wetness exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
