<p>Since common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or wetness exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
