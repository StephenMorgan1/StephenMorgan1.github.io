<h3>Fire And Water Restoration in Roslyn</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health danger and must be gotten rid of if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the idea of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
