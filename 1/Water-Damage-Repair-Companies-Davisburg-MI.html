<p>Damage triggered by water that has been on the ground at some time prior to entering your home is considered to be water flood damage and is not covered by a basic property owner's insurance policy. Water flood damage can be guaranteed only with a flood insurance coverage composed by the National Flood Insurance Coverage Program (NFIP)-- no other insurance coverage will cover flood damage. NFIP is readily available through your insurance company or local Federal Emergency Management (FEMA) office. Their website is also an excellent resource for extra information about water floods, including readiness, data and disaster assistance services.</p>
<p>When standing water is removed, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has soaked up (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) remove the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process consists of inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outside air can likewise set a drying task back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any changes if you have questions on this.</p>
<p>Under the law, it is your right to identify what company will carry out operate in your home or organisation. Some insurance coverage carriers have actually chosen contractors" that they suggest, who have arrangements with the insurer to deal with water losses in a specific way, and at pre-determined costs.
