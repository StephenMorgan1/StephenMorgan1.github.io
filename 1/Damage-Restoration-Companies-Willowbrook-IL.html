<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air up until they land somewhere. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the exact same way, so if the location the spores land is excellent and moist, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
