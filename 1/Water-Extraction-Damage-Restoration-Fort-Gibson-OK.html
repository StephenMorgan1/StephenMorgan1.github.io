<p>Whether it takes place in your ceiling due to the fact that of a leaky roof, condensation from your central air conditioning, or flooding, repairing water-damaged drywall can cause you anxiety and irritation, particularly if you've never ever done it in the past. Mold needs just 3 things to grow and make it through: darkness, humidity and moisture. The most typical areas in your house for mold growth are basements, showers, around heating and cooling devices, ducts, carpets and crawlspaces. The best way to avoid mold growth is to get rid of water leaks or wetness in your home. See our article, How Do I Prevent Mold Development?" for mold prevention tips.</p>
<p>Because the gypsum drywall is permeable and soluble in water, getting it wet can turn into a major headache. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get wet and simply starts to droop prior to drying out, repairing it might just need pushing it back into location, securing it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
