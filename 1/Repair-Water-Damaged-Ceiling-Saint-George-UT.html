<p>Deterioration is a process, which converts refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the progressive and sluggish wear and tear of materials (typically metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion occurs when you combine electrical energy, oxygen, metal and water, developing iron oxide (or what is more typically referred to as rust). There is no reputable schedule for this process to happen; a MacBook's internal components usually start wearing away instantly after the spill, however sometimes your Mac can work usually for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of an issue. How quickly the deterioration process takes depends on a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and the length of time the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all until you can attend to the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust brought on by a water spill.</p>
