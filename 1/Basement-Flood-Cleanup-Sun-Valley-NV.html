<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold professionals generally recommend is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the solution on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush until the mold vanishes. Due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to wash it off. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such products soak up water easily. This could exacerbate the problem due to the fact that as you understand - mold loves wet environments.<p>
