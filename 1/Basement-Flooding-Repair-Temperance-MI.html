<p>Next usage the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to clean the soot and smoke stains. This phase is important, as these sponges utilize special chemicals to lift discolorations from walls. Never ever utilize soot cleaner or water before you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you might spread out the soot and make it difficult to eliminate with a chemical sponge. Begin cleaning the walls carefully with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're always using a clean surface. When all sides are stained, slice off the sides with a knife to expose fresh surface areas beneath. Or simply get a new sponge. Make sure you use a cleaning motion the whole time. If you scrub the discolorations, you might spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface.</p>
