Did you understand that smoke is in fact made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will include browsing a wide location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
