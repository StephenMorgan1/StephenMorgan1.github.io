<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. An automatic shut-off valve is outstanding insurance coverage to have in any situation, particularly when the water heater unit lies inside the home.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have actually ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
