<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always practical. Using paper tape needs some practice and little finesse, however it's well worth discovering. When the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the service technician will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this point, the water remediation process is considered to finish.<p>
