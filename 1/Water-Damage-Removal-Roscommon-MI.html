<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your house or business is among the most terrible things that can happen to an individual or a household. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired rather than being completely replaced. If there is minor damage then the majority of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard might need repairing. Nevertheless, if the damage is significant then the entire floor might need changing and often even the subfloor also. The sort of wood flooring you may have figures out and limits the type of repairs that need to occur. Solid hardwood flooring permits a broader series of options to repair the problem. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface. This type of floor covering can also have replacements for specific planks. The very best method to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to replace the affected boards and then refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
