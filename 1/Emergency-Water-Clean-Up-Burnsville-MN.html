<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to evaluate which drying devices or techniques will be the most effective. It is imperative to figure out if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature level and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in determining what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and reasonable energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately forecasts the energy evaluation of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure materials and how they react to each one and supply the best evaporation results. The higher the number, the quicker materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more valuable if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
