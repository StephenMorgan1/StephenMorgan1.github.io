<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many people think that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve searching a broad location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>

Begin wiping the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a various side so you're constantly utilizing a clean surface. When all sides are soiled, trim the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surfaces below. Or just grab a new sponge. Ensure you use a wiping motion the entire time. You may spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface if you scrub the stains.</p>
