<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Albuquerque - Restore Your Home and Your Life After Fire</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health hazard and must be eliminated if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
