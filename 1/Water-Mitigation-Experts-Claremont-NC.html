<p>Whether it takes place in your ceiling due to the fact that of a dripping roof, condensation from your central air conditioning, or flooding, fixing water-damaged drywall can trigger you anxiety and aggravation, particularly if you have actually never done it before. Mold requires simply three things to grow and make it through: wetness, darkness and humidity. The most common locations in your house for mold development are basements, showers, around heating and cooling home appliances, crawlspaces, ducts and carpets. The very best way to avoid mold growth is to eliminate water leakages or moisture in your home. See our post, How Do I Prevent Mold Development?" for mold prevention tips.</p>
<p>Mold remediation must not just kill an existing growth, but also make sure mold does not discover a way to come back. Our 10-year service warranty assures that the EPA-registered anti-microbial we utilize will keep mold from growing back after it is eliminated. The anti-microbial is water-based and non-toxic, so you don't need to have any worries about leaching, VOC emissions or other ecological or irritant issues. We go into more detail about our avoidance strategies listed below. At Mold Solutions NW, we don't simply wish to get rid of mold - we don't desire it to ever grow back.</p>
