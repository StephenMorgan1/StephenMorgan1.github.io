The offender might have been something as simple as a pressure relief valve requiring replacing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>

While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can cause enduring damage and needs to be dealt with by experienced professionals, heat is the most visible, and devastating, item of this chemical reaction.
