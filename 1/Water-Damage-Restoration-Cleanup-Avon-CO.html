<p>Current Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away whatever else.  We were very happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got a lot performed in one day!  Someone has actually come out each day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job appropriately. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
