The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to examine which drying devices or methods will be the most reliable.

These conditions can assist in identifying what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, practical and latent energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly predicts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to numerous building products and how they respond to each one and offer the best evaporation results. The greater the number, the quicker products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more helpful if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
