<h3>Smoke Clean Up Service in Dracut</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold experts usually advise is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the solution on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush until the mold vanishes. There's no need to rinse it off since borax will keep the mold from coming back. Nevertheless, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such products soak up water easily. This could intensify the problem due to the fact that as you know - mold likes wet environments.<p>
