<p>Deterioration is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the slow and progressive deterioration of materials (usually metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion takes place when you integrate electricity, metal, oxygen and water, developing iron oxide (or what is more frequently known as rust). There is no reliable schedule for this process to occur; a MacBook's internal components normally start rusting instantly after the spill, but sometimes your Mac can work normally for days or weeks without revealing any obvious sign of an issue. How fast the corrosion process takes depends upon a lots of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and how long the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all up until you can deal with the damage. Below are a few examples of deterioration brought on by a water spill.</p>
