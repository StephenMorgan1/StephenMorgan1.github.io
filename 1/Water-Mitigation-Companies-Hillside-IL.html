The sort of wood flooring you might have determines and limits the type of repair work that require to happen. Strong hardwood floor covering allows for a broader series of choices to fix the problem. With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface.
