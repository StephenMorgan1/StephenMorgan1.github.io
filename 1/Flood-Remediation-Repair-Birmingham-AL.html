<p>Mold loves to grow in your house's attic and crawl areas, but what brought the mold in the very first location? The short answer: darkness and the presence of moisture in the environment. Stone floorings need less time to replace than water damaged hardwood floors. A total floor replacement can be expected to be completed in four to 10 days. Water damaged walls often peel and may require both repair and repainting; the latter service requires a number of hours.<p>
<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier because it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I prefer paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't always convenient. Using paper tape requires some practice and little skill, but it's well worth finding out. When the meters check out moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the technician will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this moment, the water remediation process is considered to complete.<p>
