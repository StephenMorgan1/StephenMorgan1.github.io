<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repairs. By minimizing the density here, it's easier to conceal long taped joints under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it's important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is ended up, this helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
