Standing water and bulk sewage should be extracted with self-contained vacuum devices with proper waste holding tanks which should be dealt with effectively. Hard surface areas that are affected need to be cleaned up and sterilized. Soft structural materials such as carpeting, carpet pads, plaster wallboard need to be eliminated and appropriately dealt with. Any material that soaks up significant quantities of wetness and can not be sufficiently cleaned up should be gotten rid of. As soon as infected products have actually been removed, a second application of sanitizers need to be used to all work surfaces.</p>
