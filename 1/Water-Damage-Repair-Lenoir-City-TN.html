<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run.

The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Daily moisture readings need to be included in the drying record to consist of heating and cooling, air, and equipment systems. Wetness content levels for wet structural materials must be recorded in a moisture material spreadsheet to show the progress of drying These taped moisture material readings will show that the structure is back to an appropriate variety of pre-loss condition. It is essential to know that air records alone will not show that a structure is dry.
