<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

There are no health or exposure-based requirements that you can utilize to assess a mold tasting result. The Florida Department of Health does not recommend mold screening or sampling to see if you have a mold issue, or to see what sort of mold may be growing. Testing for mold in the air can be expensive and, if done, should just be done by experienced professionals. Examine a mold issue; don't test</p>
