<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of home damage that a household or organisation can experience. Time is vital when water has actually flooded your home.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
