Conditions conducive to drying at the surface differ from moving excess wetness within the products or assemblies. Fast air movement throughout the surface of material becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface area moisture paves the way to reducing moisture content in low evaporation materials. The constant and falling rates of drying materials require various criteria for altering conditions.</p>
