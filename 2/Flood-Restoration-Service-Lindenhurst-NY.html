<p>Step 5: Restoration - The greatest step in the procedure is restoration. Restoration involves changing materials like drywall and insulation.

Water intrusion where wet, permeable materials (e.g., carpet, gypsum board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry system (CMU), fabrics) represent more than ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling surface area in the area; and where products referred to as low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floorings, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have taken in minimal wetness.</p>
<p>When standing water is removed, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually taken in (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) remove the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any modifications if you have concerns on this.</p>

Furthermore, if you have water logged drywall or a constant leakage, it is incredibly crucial that you do something about it before mold or mildew establish.
