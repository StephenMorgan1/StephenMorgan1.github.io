<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were very happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to do the job appropriately. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>

In the much shorter term, a mold invasion can trigger extreme health problems.<p>
