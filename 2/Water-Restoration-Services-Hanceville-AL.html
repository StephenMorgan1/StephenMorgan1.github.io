<p>The area that is being treated is sealed, as mold spores can quickly travel once they are disturbed. Air filtration systems are normally utilized in conjunction with the sealing of the location to get rid of as lots of air-borne spores as possible and to prevent spread. Sealing the area involves making use of both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, in addition to negative atmospheric pressure, which prevents the flow of air between the polluted space and the areas around it.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he discovered how much water costs I was paying because the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Very respectful and easy-going individual.</p>
