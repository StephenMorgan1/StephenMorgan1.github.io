Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
