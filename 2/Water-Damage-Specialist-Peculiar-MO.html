Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt how much water bill I was paying since the leakage began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve.
