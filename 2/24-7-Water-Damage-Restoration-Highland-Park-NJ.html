<h2>About Water Damage On Wood Floors in Highland Park</h2>

<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air till they land somewhere. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the exact same way, so if the location the spores land is good and damp, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
