<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air up until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the very same way, so if the place the spores land is excellent and wet, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores.
