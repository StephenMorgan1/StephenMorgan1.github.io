Examples of Category 3 water can consist of, but are not restricted to: sewage; toilet backflows that stem from beyond the toilet trap regardless of visible material or color; all forms of flooding from seawater; ground surface water and increasing water from rivers or streams; and other infected water entering or affecting the indoor environment, such as wind-driven rain from typhoons, hurricanes, or other weather related occasions. Such water sources may carry silt, raw material, pesticides, heavy metals, controlled materials, or toxic natural substances.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have actually become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
