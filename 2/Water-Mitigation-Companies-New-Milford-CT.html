As pointed out, fast air motion across damp surfaces of assemblies or materials is a crucial component of effectively and effectively drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area vary from moving excess wetness within the products or assemblies.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
