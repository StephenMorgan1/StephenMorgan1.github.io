<p>Corrosion is a process, which converts refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the progressive and sluggish degeneration of materials (usually metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion takes place when you integrate electrical energy, water, metal and oxygen, developing iron oxide (or what is more frequently referred to as rust). There is no reliable timetable for this procedure to occur; a MacBook's internal elements typically start rusting right away after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can operate usually for days or weeks without showing any obvious indication of a problem. How quickly the rust procedure takes depends upon a ton of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and how long the gadget remained in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can address the damage. Below are a couple of examples of deterioration caused by a water spill.</p>
