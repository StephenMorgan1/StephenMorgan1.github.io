As soon as MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other components. The liquid's salts and minerals right away begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Typically, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with a really pricey paperweight if this rust process is not stopped.</p>
