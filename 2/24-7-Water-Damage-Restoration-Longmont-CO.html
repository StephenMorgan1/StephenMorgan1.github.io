<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of home damage that a household or company can experience. When MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a power source offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this corrosion process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a really expensive paperweight.</p>
