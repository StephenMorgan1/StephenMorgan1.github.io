<h3>From Fire Water Restoration to Mold Removal in Jackson</h3>
<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold professionals normally recommend is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the solution on the surface affected by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush until the mold vanishes. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to wash it off. Nevertheless, do not utilize this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall. Such materials soak up water easily. This might worsen the problem because as you know - mold likes moist environments.<p>
