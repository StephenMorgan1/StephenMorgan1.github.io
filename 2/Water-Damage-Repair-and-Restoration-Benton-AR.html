<h2>The Role of Professional Water Damage Experts in Benton</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Getting it wet can turn into a major headache due to the fact that the plaster drywall is soluble and porous in water. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get damp and simply begins to sag before drying out, fixing it may just require pressing it back into place, securing it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
