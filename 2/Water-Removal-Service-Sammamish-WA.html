Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, but when he discovered how much water costs I was paying given that the leakage started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the location of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve.
