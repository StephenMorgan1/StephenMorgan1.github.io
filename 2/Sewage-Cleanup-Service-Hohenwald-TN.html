If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a permanent health risk and must be removed.

This develops a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the suggestion of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
