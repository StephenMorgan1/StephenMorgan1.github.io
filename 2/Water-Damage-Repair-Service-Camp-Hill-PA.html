<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier since it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't always convenient. Utilizing paper tape needs some practice and little finesse, however it's well worth finding out.

<p>Use a cloth or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, due to the fact that it could mistakenly push liquid into the phone's more delicate parts. You might attempt vacuuming around the phone's openings and cracks to suck more water out if the phone was totally submerged. When the mold is gone, the chore isn't over yet. Appropriate cleanup after mold removal is necessary to avoid recontamination. You need to seal and immediately get rid of products that may have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse the boots or shoes you wore while cleaning, wash your clothing in hot water, and shower to remove spores that might have be on your hair or skin.<p>
