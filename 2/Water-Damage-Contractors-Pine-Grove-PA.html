They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next service day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.
