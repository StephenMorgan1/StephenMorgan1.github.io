<h3>Water Damage Cleaning Services in Spokane Washington</h2>
<p>When a customer calls with a water damage emergency, our group is prepared to respond immediately. Immediate water extraction and drying is essential to include the extent of the water damage and not risk further damage. If water sits too long, mold ends up being a major risk.

First, bleach is a chemical and can affect people with chemical level of sensitivities specifically if used in locations that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more effective at getting rid of mold than a mild cleaning agent and a wet fabric, so we recommend the least hazardous option.</p>
<p>No requirement to take a damaging ball to the whole house at the sight of a little mold. You can keep the price down by focusing simply on the area where there is visible mold. For instance, mold on drywall in one corner of the space just needs cut out and changed in that corner. Yes, the rest of the space (and maybe adjacent rooms) should be cleaned, however just damaged drywall needs to be eliminated and changed.</p>
