<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or organisation is among the most terrible things that can occur to a family or an individual. To limit damage to individual valuables, get rid of any items that can be moved.

Walls and ceilings that require to be cleaned are first cleaned up with a dry chem-sponge, then with a degreaser and ventilating agent. These multiple steps are needed to ensure ceilings and walls are clean and that recurring smell has actually been eliminated.</p>
