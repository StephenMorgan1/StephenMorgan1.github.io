<p>Whether your home has been flooded by damaged pipes or a leaky roof, it is very important to remove all infected and wet products in your house as soon as possible.

Refrigerators, hot water heater, cleaning makers and dishwaters are all have numerous parts that are susceptible to degeneration, so keep a careful watch on older models. The 2 greatest offenders for water damage in homes are washing machines and hot water tanks.<p>
