<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Juice three to 5 lemons and put over affected area. Let it sit for five minutes, and after that wipe it away with a damp towel. Similar to some of the above techniques, you can use a toothbrush to scrub at the issue zone if you seem like the towel isn't working all right. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little additional heft to the mold-removal process.</p>

<p>Particular areas of your home such as crawl areas, attics and basements are a lot more susceptible to water damage. Dark, moist crawl spaces can be a sanctuary for mold and mildew, which is turn can then cause structural damage as they thrive. If there is moisture dripping through it, the concrete structure of your home can trigger leaking in the basement. Condensation in the location in between the attic and your home can trigger moisture on the underside of the roofing, which can result in mold and rotting. When checking your home for potential reasons for water damage make certain to keep an eye out for moisture in lighting fixtures as well as the overall condition of any visible piping.</p>

<p>We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.
