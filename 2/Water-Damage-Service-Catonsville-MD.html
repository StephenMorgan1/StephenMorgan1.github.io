<h2>Flood Restoration Tips in Catonsville: What to Do After a Storm</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Look for noticeable mold growth (it might look cottony, silky, rough, or leathery and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically appears as a staining or fuzzy development on furniture or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Look for indications of moisture or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water stains, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was simple: It was a perfect storm"-- a mix that lawyers now allege originated from pressure to develop faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure products, and little federal government and home builder oversight. Contribute to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the average yearly rains is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much greater.</p>
