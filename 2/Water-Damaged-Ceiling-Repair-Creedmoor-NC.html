<p>Mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Experts have identified Pennsylvania the center of an industrywide epidemic that has impacted sprawling suburban homes, starter houses, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike.

Some are 10 or twenty years old. Others are new.</p>
<p>Since common building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or moisture direct exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
