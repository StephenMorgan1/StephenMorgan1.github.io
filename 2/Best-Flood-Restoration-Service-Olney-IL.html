<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and pour over afflicted area. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and after that wipe it away with a moist towel. As with a few of the above methods, you can use a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you seem like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little additional heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was basic: It was a perfect storm"-- a mix that attorneys now allege originated from pressure to construct faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building materials, and little government and contractor oversight.
