<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or business is one of the most destructive things that can occur to a family or a person. To begin resolving a water damaged wall or ceiling in your home, you should determine the source of the water.

<p>Because common building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
