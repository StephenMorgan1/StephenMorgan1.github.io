<p>An insurance coverage might or may not cover the costs related to water damage and the process of water damage restoration. While a common cause of residential water damage is often the failure of a sump pump, lots of house owner's insurance coverage do not cover the associated expenses without an addendum which adds to the monthly premium of the policy. Frequently the verbiage of this addendum is similar to "Sewer and Drain Pipes Protection".</p>

<p>Floorings or walls, this is a sure sign of mold growth if there are dark areas on your ceiling. Musty smells and mildew are often signs that mold may be growing in your home.

Also, high humidity levels such as condensation on glass and metal surfaces are a warning sign of mold.</p>

For example, mold on drywall in one corner of the room only requires eliminated and replaced in that corner. Yes, the remainder of the space (and possibly adjacent spaces) should be cleaned, but just damaged drywall needs to be cut out and replaced.</p>
