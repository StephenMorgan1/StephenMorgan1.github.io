Standing water and moisture develop the best environment for germs and mold Prolonged exposure to an environment like this can lead to allergic reactions and even disease. Step 4: Cleaning and sanitizing is extremely crucial after water extraction and drying. Although the water is eliminated, gray water and black water require detailed sanitation to keep household members and family pets safe.<p>
<p>Mold needs nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperature levels to grow. Nutrients for mold exist in dead organic product such as wood, paper or fabrics; mold can likewise obtain nutrients from some synthetic products such as adhesives and paints. Mold needs wetness, although some mold species can get that wetness from wet air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent. Carefully pry baseboards far from walls so that you can inspect sheetrock at floor level. The porous material can rapidly soak up flood water, and you need to know the level of prospective damage.<p>
