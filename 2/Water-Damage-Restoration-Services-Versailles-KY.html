<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>We are considered one of the best mold remediation companies in Dallas, TX. We take mold remediation very seriously at Water Mold Fire Restoration and follow a well-planned remediation procedure. If your home has actually seen some water damage, there are chances that there may be some type of mold. Offer us a call and we will send somebody right away for an assessment if you believe that your house or parts of your home have mold. In the case of no noticeable mold, we can use an evaluation and inform you if there is an issue present; in fact, we can even test the mold sample to see its extent and make a strategy. You can even send us a picture of the mold in your home if you identify it on permeable surfaces such as a curio, drywall or wood , and request free guidance.</p>
