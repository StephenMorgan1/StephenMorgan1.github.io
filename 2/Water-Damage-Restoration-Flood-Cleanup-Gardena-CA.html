<p>Due to the fact that common building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is usually related to water or moisture exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
