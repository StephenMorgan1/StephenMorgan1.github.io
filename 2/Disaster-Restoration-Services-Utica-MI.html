Also, due to the fact that it's in the air, it's almost impossible to contain. Even after a fire is snuffed out, smoke in the air can trigger damage. Smoke damage restoration services are often required to bring back damage left from small indoor fires.</p>

<p>Recent Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and carried away everything else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to do the job appropriately. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
