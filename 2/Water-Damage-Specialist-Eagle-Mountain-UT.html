<p>Next use the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to clean the soot and smoke spots. This stage is vital, as these sponges utilize unique chemicals to lift spots from walls. Never use soot cleaner or water before you utilize a dry-cleaning sponge, or you could spread out the soot and make it difficult to eliminate with a chemical sponge. Start cleaning the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're always utilizing a clean surface. When all sides are soiled, slice off the sides with a knife to expose fresh surface areas underneath. Or simply get a brand-new sponge. Ensure you use a wiping motion the entire time.
