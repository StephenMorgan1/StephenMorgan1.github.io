Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he found out just how much water costs I was paying given that the leak started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning!

<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Irvington</h3>
<p>Get rid of wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a long-term health risk and should be eliminated if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the tip of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
