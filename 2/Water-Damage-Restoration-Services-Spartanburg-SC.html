An automatic shut-off valve is excellent insurance coverage to have in any situation, especially when the water heater system lies inside the home.

The culprit may have been something as easy as a pressure relief valve needing changing or something devastating like a tank failure.</p>

Nevertheless, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material ought to be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be removed to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>To prevent mold in the basement, you need to modify the conditions that can cause it to grow. Initially, eliminate wetness by setting up a dehumidifier and making certain the clothes dryer vent exhausts externally, if you utilize your basement for laundry.
