<h3>Smoke Damage Repair in Algona</h3>
<p>When you are preparing large repairs, remember that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By minimizing the density here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it's important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is ended up, this assists strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
