<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals think that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion happens, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
