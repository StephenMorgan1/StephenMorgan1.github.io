<p>Because common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
