These 10 actions get you on the road to flooded bathroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to raise and agitate the dampened mold. Move the brush in mindful strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health concern. After scrubbing completely with the brush, wipe the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
