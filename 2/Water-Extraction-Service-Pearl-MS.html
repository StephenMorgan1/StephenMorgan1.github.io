<p>If the wet iPhone is in a case, remove it; take the SIM card out too. (Getting rid of the battery would not harm either, however just if you're confident about the technicalities and do not mind voiding the service warranty.) These actions assist to reduce the variety of nooks and crannies where water can remain, and avoid damage to elements. Next, scrub the location to remove all of the mold and mold spots. And lastly, wipe the surface area to eliminate recurring mold and spores.<p>
<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, numerous expert drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I prefer paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always practical. Utilizing paper tape requires some practice and little skill, but it's well worth learning. As soon as the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the professional will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this point, the water remediation process is thought about to finish.<p>
