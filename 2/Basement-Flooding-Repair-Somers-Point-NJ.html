<p>Deterioration is a process, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the progressive and slow deterioration of products (usually metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the rust takes place when you combine electrical energy, water, metal and oxygen, developing iron oxide (or what is more commonly called rust). There is no trusted timetable for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal components usually begin corroding right away after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can operate normally for days or weeks without showing any obvious indication of an issue. How quick the rust process takes depends upon a lots of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and the length of time the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all till you can address the damage. Below are a couple of examples of corrosion brought on by a water spill.</p>
