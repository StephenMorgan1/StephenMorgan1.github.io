<p>A bleach service also works to eliminate mold. Mix one cup of bleach in a gallon of water, apply to the surface area and do not rinse. As family devices get older, their pipelines might start to split and rust and their connections or hose pipes can weaken as the products age. Fridges, water heaters, cleaning machines and dishwaters are all have lots of parts that are prone to wear and tear, so keep a cautious watch on older designs. The two biggest offenders for water damage in houses are cleaning devices and hot water tanks.<p>
