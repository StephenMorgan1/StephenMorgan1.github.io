This can arise from any number of situations such as flooding, water build-up after a fire, a broken pipe, and even a malfunctioning A/C system - all of which can result in trouble. Any high degree of wetness, combined with temperature and nutrients, creates the best environment for the fungal parts of mold and mildew to grow. It is essential to remove the source of the moisture to prevent the spread of mold contamination as soon as possible.</p>
<p>More involved screening might include sending samples to a screening facility, or taking samples of the air to test if there is no noticeable mold, however mold is suspected.
