Together, we had the ability to develop a brand-new mold-assessment system for industrial consumers that, unlike any other method or device, can deliver scientifically accurate, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so instantly. So when you consider all the threats of mold, InstaScope is an important tool to help ensure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>
