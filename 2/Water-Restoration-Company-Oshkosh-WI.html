<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Oshkosh</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repairs. By lowering the thickness here, it's simpler to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is very important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is finished, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
