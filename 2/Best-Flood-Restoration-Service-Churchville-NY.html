In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it is very important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is ended up.<p>
