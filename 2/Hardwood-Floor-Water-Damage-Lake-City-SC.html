Start wiping the walls carefully with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a various side so you're always using a clean surface. When all sides are soiled, slice off the sides with a knife to expose fresh surface areas underneath. Or merely grab a brand-new sponge. Make certain you use a wiping motion the whole time.
