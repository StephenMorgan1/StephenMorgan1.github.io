<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have actually ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>

<p>You can never ever entirely get rid of mold from your home; a little number of mold spores will always exist inside and are a natural and practical  part of our world.

<p>Rust is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the progressive and slow deterioration of materials (generally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the rust happens when you combine electrical power, oxygen, water and metal, producing iron oxide (or what is more frequently referred to as rust). There is no reliable schedule for this process to occur; a MacBook's internal elements typically start wearing away right away after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can function normally for days or weeks without showing any apparent sign of an issue. How fast the deterioration process takes depends on a ton of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and how long the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can resolve the damage. Below are a couple of examples of deterioration caused by a water spill.</p>
