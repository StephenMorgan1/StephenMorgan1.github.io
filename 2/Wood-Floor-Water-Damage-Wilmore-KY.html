<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was simple: It was an ideal storm"-- a mix that lawyers now allege came from pressure to develop faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building products, and little government and contractor oversight. Contribute to that a climate like Pennsylvania's, where the typical annual rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the capacity for water damage was that much greater.</p>
