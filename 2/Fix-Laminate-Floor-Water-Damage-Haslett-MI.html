When moist drywall sits with insufficient ventilation, mold and mildew take place most frequently. Regardless of the area or level of the damage, we encourage using dehumidifiers, industrial fans, or similar machines that can move a large volume of air for maximum ventilation. Standard family fans are not efficient in moving an adequate amount of air required to dry a room adequately.</p>
