<p>One day, I got back from work thinking I 'd be able to relax.

I never had to handle this before, so I googled and chose RestorePro based upon all the positive reviews. From start to end up, it was an incredibly positive experience. They effectively finished the mitigation and then dealt with me through the whole reconstruction to make certain that 1) quality work was done 2) we might upgrade where I wanted while being extremely transparent about expense and 3) that my home and my household were treated with respect. I would 100% hire them again if we have to go through a process like this once again.</p>

<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he discovered just how much water costs I was paying because the leakage started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the place of the leakage for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve. Really courteous and easy-going individual.</p>
