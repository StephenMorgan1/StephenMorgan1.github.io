Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a globally acknowledged professional on the biological elements of air contamination, this team was designated to verify and test the brand-new innovation.

Together, we had the ability to create a brand-new mold-assessment system for business customers that, unlike any other method or device, can deliver scientifically accurate, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so quickly.

<p>The devices we utilize can running for days without being turned off (it will not overheat), and unless we advise you otherwise, it is best to leave it on and running at perpetuity until the job is finished.

<p>When standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has soaked up (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) remove the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any changes.</p>
