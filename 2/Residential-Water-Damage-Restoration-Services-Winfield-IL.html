<p>Smoke damage is a typical side effect of fire damage, however it can occur by itself if a fire is included. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This kind of dehumidifier produces the most affordable humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers soak up wetness through chemical attraction instead of condensation to remove water from the air. A desiccant is a material that holds and draws in moisture.
