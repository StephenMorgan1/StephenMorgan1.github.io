<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences.

<h3>Tips To Restoration And Clean-Up After Smoke And Fire Damage in Chadds Ford</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a permanent health hazard and must be gotten rid of. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the tip of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
