<p>The most essential element of fixing drywall water damage is to prevent extra damage from mold or mildew. Mold and mildew take place most regularly when moist drywall sits with insufficient ventilation. Despite the location or level of the damage, we encourage using dehumidifiers, industrial fans, or similar devices that can move a large volume of air for optimum ventilation. Basic household fans are not efficient in moving an adequate quantity of air needed to dry a space sufficiently.</p>
