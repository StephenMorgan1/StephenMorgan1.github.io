Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, but when he learnt how much water bill I was paying since the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the place of the leakage for me and then even assisted me closed down my primary water valve.
