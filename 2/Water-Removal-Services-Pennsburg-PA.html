It is the steady and slow deterioration of products (usually metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion happens when you combine electrical energy, water, metal and oxygen, creating iron oxide (or what is more commonly called rust). There is no reliable timetable for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal components typically begin corroding right away after the spill, but sometimes your Mac can operate normally for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of a problem. How quick the deterioration procedure takes depends upon a lots of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and for how long the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid.
