<h3>Why You Should Hire Clarks Summit Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be a permanent health threat and need to be eliminated if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the idea of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
