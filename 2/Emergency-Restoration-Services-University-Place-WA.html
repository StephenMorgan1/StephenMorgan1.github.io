As soon as MacBook water damage has actually happened, the liquid will likely make its method to the reasoning board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Typically, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with an extremely costly paperweight if this deterioration process is not stopped.</p>
