<p>Because common structure products can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

Need to you choose to use bleach or another chemical, please read and carefully follow the label instructions and threat declarations (care, warning, risk). Do not mix bleach with ammonia cleaners or acids, because a dangerous chlorine gas might be formed.</p>
