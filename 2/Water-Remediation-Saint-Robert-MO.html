<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) advises discarding products that have not been thoroughly cleaned up and dried within 48 hours of water damage. Repair any leaks or underlying problems right now to help prevent mold development or its return. Mold exists naturally in the air inside and beyond your home.

<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and carried away everything else.  We were really pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to get the job done correctly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
