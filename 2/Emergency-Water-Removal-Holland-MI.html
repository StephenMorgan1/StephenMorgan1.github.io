<p>With houses along the west coast here in Seattle, we can frequently experience some of the most damp conditions. Both throughout the summer and chillier months, wetness content can be overwhelming at times can attribute to much of the needed conditions for the extreme rainfall we can expect every year. Between this greater wetness content, wet basements, and conditions like inadequately dried water losses - mold is a lot more typical than many property owners may believe.<p>
<p>Water (and dust) resistance is commonly expressed by the IP score system Before 2016 Apple didn't launch IP rankings for its phones, however that year's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were certified as IP67 - an exceptional rating which shows they should survive submersion in up to 1m of water for thirty minutes.

<p>Recent Evaluation: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were very delighted that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to finish the job properly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
