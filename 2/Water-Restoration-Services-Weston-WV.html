<p>Since typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or wetness exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
