<h3>Fire Restoration Cleaning in Arlington</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health hazard and need to be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the tip of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
