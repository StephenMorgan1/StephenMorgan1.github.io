<p>Mold requires nutrients, water, oxygen and beneficial temperatures to grow. Nutrients for mold exist in dead natural product such as wood, paper or materials; mold can also derive nutrients from some synthetic items such as adhesives and paints. Mold requires moisture, although some mold species can get that moisture from damp air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent. Carefully pry baseboards far from walls so that you can inspect sheetrock at floor level. The porous material can rapidly soak up flood water, and you need to understand the extent of possible damage.<p>
