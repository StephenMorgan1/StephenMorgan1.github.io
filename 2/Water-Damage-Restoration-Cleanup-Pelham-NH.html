<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Black mold can be hazardous to your health, primarily causing respiratory concerns. But in extreme cases and for people with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can result in pneumonia.
