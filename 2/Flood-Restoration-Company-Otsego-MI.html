<p>Since common building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or wetness direct exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
