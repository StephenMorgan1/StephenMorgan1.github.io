<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air up until they land someplace. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same method, so if the location the spores land is wet and great, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>

<p>Fire is the result of a chain reaction in between the oxygen that exists in the environment and a source of flammable fuel. As soon as this combustible fuel - drywall, carpet, or furnishings - has been heated to its special ignition temperature, the fuel will ignite and volatile gases will be launched in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can cause enduring damage and should be handled by knowledgeable professionals, heat is the most obvious, and devastating, item of this chain reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - meaning that as a fire comes into contact with extra fuel, the reaction continues and the fire spreads.</p>
