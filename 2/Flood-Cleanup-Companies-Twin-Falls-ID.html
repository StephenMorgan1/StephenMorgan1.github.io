<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of property damage that a family or service can experience. Once MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components.

This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. If this rust process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with an extremely pricey paperweight.</p>
