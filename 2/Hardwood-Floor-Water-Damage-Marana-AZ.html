<p>Whether it happens in your ceiling because of a dripping roof, condensation from your central air, or flooding, repairing water-damaged drywall can cause you stress and anxiety and stress, especially if you have actually never done it before. Mold needs simply three things to grow and survive: wetness, humidity and darkness. The most typical areas in your house for mold growth are basements, showers, around heating and cooling devices, crawlspaces, carpets and ducts. The very best method to avoid mold development is to eliminate water leaks or moisture in your house. See our article, How Do I Avoid Mold Growth?" for mold prevention suggestions.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have actually become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
