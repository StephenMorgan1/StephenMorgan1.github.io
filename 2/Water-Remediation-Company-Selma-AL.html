<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of property damage that a household or service can experience. Once MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts.

This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this rust process is not stopped, you will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight.</p>
