Seeing visible mold on the walls is another indication, but not everybody notices mold within their houses. Before mold is located, you may smell a distinct musty scent or experience allergy signs due to mold direct exposure. These smells are specifically pungent in areas like the basement. The nasty smell resembles the aroma of damp, musty laundry. Sadly, it's not uncommon for homeowners to mistake mold development for dirt.</p>

<p>If smoke and fire damage has affected your possessions, we will work with you and your insurance provider to identify what can be restored, and what will be an insurance coverage replacement claim. For items that can be brought back, we use ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged valuables. For this, we utilized Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is act like a glue which penetrates into permeable surface area, avoiding water from leaking back through. Essentially, it makes the area solid again and secures the surface from future water damage. After you have applied the Peel-Stop, permit an hour of drying time.<p>

<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away whatever else.  We were very pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.

LGR dehumidifiers squeeze more moisture out of the air, compared to most basic dehumidifiers with their double-step air cooling procedure. Through either air to air or heat pipe cooling, air is completely dried out using either two-step procedure. The lower the operating temperature level, the much better it draws wetness out of the air.<p>
