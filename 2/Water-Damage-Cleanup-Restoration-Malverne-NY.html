Nutrients for mold exist in dead natural product such as wood, paper or fabrics; mold can also obtain nutrients from some synthetic items such as adhesives and paints. Mold requires wetness, although some mold species can obtain that moisture from moist air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent.
