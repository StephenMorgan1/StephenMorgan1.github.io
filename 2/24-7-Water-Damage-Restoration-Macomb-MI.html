Lots of people think that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it just goes away.

Walls and ceilings that need to be cleaned up are first cleaned up with a dry chem-sponge, then with a degreaser and deodorizing agent. These several actions are required to guarantee ceilings and walls are clean and that recurring odor has been gotten rid of.</p>
