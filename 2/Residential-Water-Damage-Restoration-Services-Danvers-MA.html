These consist of cold-like symptoms, rashes, sinus swelling, eye inflammation and stress of asthma. Some signs are more basic - such as inability to focus or tiredness. Generally, signs vanish after the mold is eliminated. Mitigation is considered an emergency service. Water has the damaging tendency to cause pervasive damage to products that absorb it.
