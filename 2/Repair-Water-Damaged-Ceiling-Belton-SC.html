<h3>Facts About House Fire Damage You Need To Be Aware Of in Belton</h3>
<p>After removing the damaged drywall, determine the size of the hole so you can cut out a spot from a new sheet of drywall. Place 4 drywall clips around the hole. Protect each one in place with a drywall screw, making sure to countersink the screw head. Be careful not to overdrive the screw. Cut out the spot and insert it, then secure it to the drywall clips (and readily available ceiling joists) using drywall screws. Beware not to over-tighten.<p>
<p>If you believe mold development in your attic  or crawl space, it is very important to be proactive. Gradually, mold left untreated will continue to grow as spores reproduce and eventually spread out, developing a larger, more expensive mold remediation job for specialists later on.
