Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
