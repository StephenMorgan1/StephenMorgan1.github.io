<p>Whether it takes place in your ceiling due to the fact that of a leaky roof, condensation from your central air conditioning, or flooding, fixing water-damaged drywall can trigger you anxiety and stress, particularly if you've never done it in the past. Mold requires just three things to grow and endure: humidity, darkness and wetness. The most common locations in your home for mold development are basements, showers, around heating and cooling appliances, crawlspaces, carpets and ducts. The best method to prevent mold growth is to eliminate water leakages or moisture in your home. See our article, How Do I Prevent Mold Development?" for mold avoidance pointers.</p>
<p>Before your home has actually dried, scrub floors and woodwork with a stiff brush, lots of water, a cleaning agent and disinfectant.
