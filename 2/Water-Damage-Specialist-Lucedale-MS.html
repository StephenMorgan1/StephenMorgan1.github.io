Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
