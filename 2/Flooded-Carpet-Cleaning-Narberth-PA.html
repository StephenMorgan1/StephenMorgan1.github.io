<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air up until they land someplace. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same way, so if the place the spores land is good and wet, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
