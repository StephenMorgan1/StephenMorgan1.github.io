<h3>Water & Fire Damage Restoration in Pasadena</h3>
<p>When you are preparing big repair work, keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By minimizing the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it's important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is completed.<p>
