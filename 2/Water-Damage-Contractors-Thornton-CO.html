<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air till they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the very same method, so if the place the spores land is damp and good, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
