Best of all, when you use an expert service, you have the comfort of knowing that your property was completely dried out, helping to avoid mold problems in the future.</p>
<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one air stream. The rotor brings the moist desiccant to the reactivation air stream to heat it up. When wet incoming air streams over a wheel filled with a silica gel desiccant, desiccant dehumidifiers work. This procedure soaks up moisture without ice accumulation and is not restricted by low temperature levels. Desiccants can quickly operate below freezing temperature levels.</p>
