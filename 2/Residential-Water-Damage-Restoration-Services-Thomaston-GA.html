Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have actually ended up being polluted with molds.

When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>
