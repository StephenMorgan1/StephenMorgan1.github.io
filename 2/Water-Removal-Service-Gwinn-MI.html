<h3>Fire Damage Claims in Gwinn - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repair work. By lowering the thickness here, it's easier to conceal long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it is necessary to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the task is finished.<p>
