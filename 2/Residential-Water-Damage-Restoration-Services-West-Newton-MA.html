<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for every two to three rooms, depending on the size of the space. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it passes through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which suggests that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the smell got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can picture, throughout several days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
