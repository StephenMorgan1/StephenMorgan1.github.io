Many individuals think that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this indicates that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include searching a broad location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
