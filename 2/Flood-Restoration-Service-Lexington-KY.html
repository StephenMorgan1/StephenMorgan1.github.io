<p>Because common building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or wetness exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
