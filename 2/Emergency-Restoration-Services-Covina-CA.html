<p>3. Licenses and other requirements: Before you get too far along in the basement finishing process, you will wish to make sure you comprehend any authorizations needed.

There are also particular codes for spacing and framing surrounding your HVAC unit and water heater. Most people leave these areas unrestricted and incomplete to make maintenances simpler.</p>
<p>Since mold and mildew can be a major health hazard, it's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to get rid of up to 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material need to be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>Because large pieces of drywall require to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists, damaged areas bigger than 12 square inches might need a total replacement panel installed. It depends on where the damage is located on the wall or ceiling and how you had to cut it out. For example, if the area where you removed the damaged drywall exposes studs or joists where it will be possible to protect a patch by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you may have to replace the entire drywall panel.</p>
